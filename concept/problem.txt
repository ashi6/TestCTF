Imagine I have a mystery polynomial in the form a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + ...
The coefficients (a, b, c, d, e, etc.) are unknown and you don't know how many of them there are (not infinite), but I will tell you that they are all positive. I will allow you to give me two inputs to plug into the polynomial and I will tell you the results. Can you come up with a process that allows you to determine all of the coefficients in two inputs?
