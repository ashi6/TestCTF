# TestCTF
CS460 Security Lab Final Project

The flags are redacted from challenges.json, so if you want to run this yourself you need to put them back in.

To run the main server:
```npm install
node app.js```

This runs on port 3333 by default.

Several challenges require a PHP service running on port 3334 serving the files in the php directory. This can be done by moving those files into /var/www/html after installing PHP and MySQL.
